          War is a crime against humanity. We stand with the people of Ukraine

          The result compilation archives a selection of recordings by artists
          from Armenia, Georgia, Russia, and Ukraine, that are working with the
          concepts of timegs contributed by artists from Armenia, Georgia,
          Russia, and Ukraine, that are working with the concepts of time and
          memory in a vast range of styles — from musique concrète, tape-loops
          and sound collage to field recordings and loose dubs. The artists were
          asked to explore how 'collective memories' could be embodied in sound
          by using some of the aural techniques capable of evoking such memories
          in the subconscious of people from locations fairly different, but
          someway similar in their cultural codeby using some of the aural
          techniques capable of evoking such memories in the subconscious of
          people from locations fairly different, but someway similar in their
          cultural code. The submissions received were not only inspiring and
          diverse, but also accurately fell in line with Urvakan's declared
          focus on "hauntological" music practices, referenced in the festival's
          vision, and the name itself — 'urvakan' is the Armenian word for
          ghost, phantom or spirithantom or spirit.
